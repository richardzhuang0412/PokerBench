### Instruction:
Recommend a movie for me to watch during the weekend and explain the reason.

### Response:
I recommend watching the movie "West Side Story." The storyline revolves around two gangs on the west side of New York. The Jets and the Sharks, who have a long-time
 feud. Tony is the leader of the Jets, and Maria is the leader of the Sharks. Tony and Maria fall in love, and their romance creates a conflict between the two rival
s.

The reason I recommend this film to you is that it is a classic tale
